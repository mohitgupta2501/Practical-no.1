## **A. Identifying the Requirements from Problem Statements**  
Requirements identification is a critical phase in software development. It involves understanding the problem statement, defining system goals, and categorizing requirements into functional and non-functional aspects. This ensures that the final system meets user needs effectively.  

---

## **B. Aim of the Experiment**  
The objective of this experiment is to analyze a given problem statement and extract the **functional and non-functional requirements** required for software development. This study will help in preparing a structured **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** for an Ayurvedic Management System.  

---

## **C. Introduction**  
In software engineering, requirements analysis is the foundation of project development. A well-defined **requirement specification** ensures that the system is developed efficiently, reducing the chances of errors and misalignment with user needs.  

For this experiment, we are considering an **Ayurvedic Management System**, a web-based platform that suggests Ayurvedic remedies based on user symptoms. The system collects user information such as **name, age, height, weight, symptoms**, and provides **personalized herbal medicine recommendations** with dosage and duration.  

---

## **D. Theory**  

### **1. Objectives**  
After completing this experiment, you will be able to:  
- Understand **functional and non-functional** requirements.  
- Analyze a problem statement to extract software requirements.  
- Differentiate between different categories of requirements.  
- Prepare a structured **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.  

---

### **2. Requirements**  
Software requirements define the functionalities and constraints of the system. These requirements are classified into:  
- **Functional Requirements (FRs)** – Define what the system should do.  
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** – Define system quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.  

---

### **3. Characteristics of Requirements**  
A good software requirement should be:  
- **Clear & Unambiguous** – Each requirement must have a single, precise meaning.  
- **Complete** – It must cover all aspects of the system.  
- **Consistent** – Requirements should not conflict with each other.  
- **Feasible** – The requirement should be realistically implementable.  
- **Testable** – It must be verifiable through testing.  

---

### **4. Categorization of Requirements**  

#### **(a) Functional Requirements (FRs)**  
These define the core functionality of the system. For the **Ayurvedic Management System**, functional requirements include:  
- **User Registration & Profile Creation** – Stores user data like age, height, weight, and symptoms.  
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis** – The system matches symptoms with a database of Ayurvedic medicines.  
- **Medicine Recommendation System** – Suggests herbs like Tulsi, Ashwagandha, and Giloy, along with dosage and duration.  
- **Search Feature** – Users can explore different Ayurvedic herbs and their benefits.  
- **Medicine Intake Reminder** – Sends notifications about medicine schedules.  

#### **(b) Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**  
These define the performance and usability aspects of the system:  
- **Performance:** Should handle multiple users efficiently.  
- **Security:** Protects user data with encryption.  
- **Usability:** Ensures a user-friendly interface.  
- **Scalability:** The system should be expandable with more data.  
- **Availability:** Ensures 24/7 accessibility.  

---

### **5. Functional Requirements**  
The system must:  
- Allow **user sign-up and login**.  
- Store **user health details and symptoms**.  
- **Analyze symptoms** and suggest Ayurvedic remedies.  
- Provide **dosage and duration** for each medicine.  
- Send **notifications/reminders** for medicine intake.  

---

## **E. Preparing Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
A structured **SRS document** consists of:  
1. **Introduction** – Overview of the system.  
2. **Functional Requirements** – Defines system capabilities.  
3. **Non-Functional Requirements** – Specifies system constraints.  
4. **System Models** – Diagrams and workflows.  
5. **Data Storage & Security Measures** – Defines how data will be handled.  

---

## **F. Case Study**  
**Scenario: A User with Fever & Headache**  
1. The user **signs up** and enters personal details.  
2. They input symptoms: **Fever, Headache**.  
3. The system suggests: **Tulsi leaves, Giloy juice, Coronil tablets**.  
4. Dosage & duration are displayed.  
5. The user receives **reminders** to take the medicine at the right time.  

---

## **G. Conclusion**  
This experiment highlights the importance of **requirement analysis** in software development. By properly identifying and categorizing requirements, we ensure that the Ayurvedic Management System is **efficient, user-friendly, and scalable**. The structured **SRS document** helps developers create a system that meets user needs while maintaining performance and security.
